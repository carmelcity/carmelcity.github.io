Carmel City is a self-governed platform for human-centric innovation, empowering members to build a more human world.

Members engage in **Carmels**—thoughtful debates on reimagining work and society—then self-organize in communities to transform ideas into impactful projects.

**Communities** fund projects, reward members for completing challenges, and distribute earnings based on membership levels. Members level up by collecting contribution points, acquiring Community Passes, and advancing through community tutorials designed to foster learning and skill-building.

**Carmel Properties**—including Community Passes, City Permits, and Project Items—are unique digital assets that represent ownership, access, and contribution within the platform. These assets generate rewards, grow in value as communities thrive, and can be freely bought, sold, or traded on the Carmel Store.

Together, we redefine work by reimagining learning, innovation, and ownership for a more human future.

## Platform Architecture

<p align="center"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carmelcity/.github/refs/heads/main/images/banner.webp" width="100%">
</p>

The Carmel City platform follows a *"sufficently decentralized"* design whereby critical functionality is decentralized while some functionality is centralized, for easy of use. Key platform components such as the treasury, or the registry are decentralized, giving members access to self-sovereign identities, decentralized data and blockchain digital assets. At the same time, passwordless email-based registrations and other centralized functionality is managed in an offchain, managed cloud platform in order to produce a beautiful, easy to use experience.

### The Blockchain System

The **Carmel City System** is a group of Smart Contracts that represent the core functionality of the Carmel City Platform, on-chain. This includes the **Carmel Verifier**, the **Carmel Registry** and the **Carmel Treasury**. The system manages contracts, handles deposits and performs self-sovereign federated account operations, and much more.

### The Decentralized Node

The **Carmel City Node** is a peer-to-peer server that connects to other nodes in the **Carmel Network**. The node can either be a **relay** that connects other nodes or a **sentinel** that handles *self-sovereign account operations* on behalf of Carmel Accounts.

### The Main Website

The **Carmel City Website** is the gateway to the Carmel City, where members collaborate, learn, and own their contributions. Here, members start by joining Carmels—thoughtful discussions on reimagining work and society. They then connect in communities to fund and launch impactful projects, while participating in challenges to earn rewards, and learn through tutorials. The website also features the Carmel Store, where Carmel Properties can be bought and sold.

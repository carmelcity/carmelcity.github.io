Carmel City is a community-owned platform that empowers people who are passionate about the future to awaken their personal innovation genius and work together to build a more human world.

Every member begins their innovation journey with a free assessment to discover their Innovation Genius Type and a secure, password-free biometric account. Each Carmel Account is fully owned by its user - not the platform - and is secured by fingerprint or face recognition, with no passwords or keys required.

Carmel City members unleash their innovation potential by engaging in Carmels - thoughtful debates on building a more human world. Members choose a side (pro or against) and share their position then engage in healthy discussions by commenting on each other’s ideas to collectively answer the key question: How would you build a more human world?

Members form communities and propose projects to bring Carmels to life. Communities fund projects, reward members for completing challenges that drive the projects forward, and share earnings based on membership levels. Along the way, members grow by earning contribution points and learning new skills through tutorials.

The Carmel City platform shares ownership with its members through unique digital assets issued by communities. Members buy and sell these assets on the Carmel Store and use them to unlock platform features, access community benefits and experiences within projects. Carmel Assets earn rewards and can level up with usage, unlocking more functionality over time.

Special actions on the platform, like creating communities or launching projects, require Carmel Tokens, which are also used to reward contributions, thus creating a circular economy. Each user gets a digital wallet to manage funds, top up with cryptocurrency, withdraw, and buy Carmel Tokens and assets from the Carmel Store with a single click.

Together, we work to awaken the innovation genius within each of us, redefining the meaning of work to create a more human world. 
As a member of Carmel City, you have a say in the future of innovation, shaping a more human world we can proudly pass on to future generations as our legacy.

## Platform Architecture

The Carmel City platform follows a *"sufficently decentralized"* design whereby critical functionality is decentralized while some functionality is centralized, for easy of use. Key platform components such as the treasury, or the registry are decentralized, giving members access to self-sovereign identities, decentralized data and blockchain digital assets. At the same time, passwordless email-based registrations and other centralized functionality is managed in an offchain, managed cloud platform in order to produce a beautiful, easy to use experience.

### The Blockchain System

The **Carmel City System** is a group of Smart Contracts that represent the core functionality of the Carmel City Platform, on-chain. This includes the **Carmel Verifier**, the **Carmel Registry** and the **Carmel Treasury**. The system manages contracts, handles deposits and performs self-sovereign federated account operations, and much more.

### The Decentralized Node

The **Carmel City Node** is a peer-to-peer server that connects to other nodes in the **Carmel Network**. The node can either be a **relay** that connects other nodes or a **sentinel** that handles *self-sovereign account operations* on behalf of Carmel Accounts.

### The Main Website

The **Carmel City Website** is the gateway to the Carmel City, where members collaborate, learn, and own their contributions. Here, members start by joining Carmels—thoughtful discussions on reimagining work and society. They then connect in communities to fund and launch impactful projects, while participating in challenges to earn rewards, and learn through tutorials. The website also features the Carmel Store, where Carmel Properties can be bought and sold.

Today is special for all those who have been following the Carmel story. We've been on an amazing and long, harduous journey to get here. But here we are. Today, the Carmel platform enters a the Private Beta phase. 

Here's what's packed in this release.

### The Carmel City Website

The first thing to notice is that the platform is publicly available for those with an invite at [carmel.city](https://carmel.city), so give that a browse.

You can request an invite and if you're already part of the private beta group, you can get involved and:

> 1. Create your account and get your username
> 2. Setup your profile image, banner and bio
> 3. Participate in Carmels
> 4. Create a biometric signature for your account
> 5. Top up your account with ETH

... invite friends, follow communities & projects and more.

### Open Source

And the cool thing is that the code for the website itself is 100% open source, under the MIT License.

But there's a lot more open source code, such as all the Blockchain Smart contracts, the decentralized peer-to-peer node and more.

Contributions from developers looking to get involved in this are now open and welcome. Head over to our GitHub open organization [@carmelcity](https://github.com/carmelcity) and browse through. All code is licensed under the MIT license.

### Participate in the Private Beta

We're taking on a small group of beta testers to help us hash out bugs and improve the overall experience before we open up the Public Beta release.

If you want to participate in this invite-only testing phase, shoot us an email [hello@carmel.city](mailto:hello@carmel.city) and we'll take it from there.

We're excited about where we go from here and we can't wait to see what the vibe inside the private beta testing group is like while we iterate on this release.
